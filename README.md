# Take the Power Back Pack for Windows 10 and Windows 11

I made this for me but decided to share it as others may find it useful.

Please read the change log in the Docs directory for each release to find out what was added, removed or changed.

This is a collection of tweaks for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Its purpose is to change the look and feel of the GUI, enhance privacy, remove unneeded software and disable services and scheduled tasks. Many thanks to Windows 10 and Windows 11 forums that provided most of the registry tweaks. 

Instead of creating an all-in-one program to do this, everything is broken out into easy-to-read registry files, PowerShell and DOS commands.
